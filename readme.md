### DataStructure
- Reverse Digits
    > [/DataStructure/ReverseDigits.java](DataStructure/ReverseDigits.java)

    Write a program which takes an integer and returns the integer corresponding to the degits of the input written in reverse order. For example 245 is 542, and 45 is 54.

- isPalindrome integer and string
    > [/DataStructure/Palindrome.java](DataStructure/Palindrome.java)

    Write a program that takes an integer and determindes if that integer's representation as decimal string is palindrom. And also write method that takes String and determines that is palindrome or not?

- Increment Arbitrary Precision
    > [/DataStructure/IncrementArbitraryPrecision.java](DataStructure/IncrementArbitraryPrecision.java)

    Write a program which takes as input an array of digits encoding a nonnegetive single decimal iteger D and updates the array to represent the integer D+1. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 9] then you should update the array to [1, 3, 0], and if input array is [9, 9, 9] then should be the array to [1, 0, 0, 0].


### Multithreading
At the basic level there two ways of creating threads. 
    [/Multithreading/ThreadBasicsRunner.java](Multithreading/ThreadBasicsRunner.java)
1. Extending the *Thread* class
2. Implementing *Runnable* interface
    
    In this example we have Task1 class which inherits Thread class and Task2 class which implements the Runnable interface.
